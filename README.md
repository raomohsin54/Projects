Welcome to my GitHub repo! My name is Mohsin Mukhtiar and I am a Business Intelligence Developer with expertise in Power BI, Tableau, DAX, Power Query M, SQL, Metabase, and data warehousing tools. In this repo, you will find my projects and data analysis project codes. My projects cover a wide range of topics, including machine learning, data visualization, and data cleaning.

All of my code is written in Python and is available for you to use, modify, and improve upon as needed. I believe in open-source and collaboration, so I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from the community.

In each project, you will find a detailed README file that explains the purpose of the project, the data sources used, the techniques employed, and the results obtained. The code is well-documented and follows best practices to ensure readability, reusability, and scalability.

I hope that my projects inspire you and help you in your own data analysis and machine learning endeavors. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter.
