The first line import streamlit as st imports the Streamlit library, which is used to create web applications in Python.

The second line import os imports the os module, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.

The third line import openai imports the OpenAI API, which is used to generate responses to user inputs.

The fourth line from dotenv import load_dotenv imports the load_dotenv function from the dotenv module, which is used to load environment variables from a .env file.

load_dotenv() is then called to load environment variables from the .env file.

The openai.api_key is then set to the value of the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

The generate_response function takes a prompt as input and uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to the prompt. It uses the text-davinci-002 language model to generate the response, with a temperature of 0.5 and a maximum of 2048 tokens.

The message function takes in text, and whether the text is from the user or not. It then prints the text with a prefix of either "You:" or "Bot:".

st.set_page_config is used to set the configuration of the Streamlit page, including the title, page icon, layout, and initial sidebar state.

st.markdown is used to display a header and a sub-header on the page, welcoming the user to the bot.

The st.session_state dictionary is used to keep track of past messages and generated responses.

The get_text function creates a text input box and waits for the user to enter text.

user_input is then set to the value of the text input box.

If user_input is not empty, the generate_response function is called to generate a response to the user input.

The past and generated lists in the st.session_state dictionary are then updated with the user input and generated response.

The message function is then called to display the past messages and generated responses on the page, with the most recent messages displayed first.

Finally, st.markdown is used to display a footer on the page, indicating that the bot was made by Mohsin and thanking the user for using it.

The st.markdown at the end sets the background color of the page to black.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions
